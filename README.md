Implemented as a part of interview process for Zappos.com

The code is live at http://cs-server.usc.edu:37995/zappos_challenge.html

I was asked to implement a simple interface where the user could input a Quantity and a Price and I had to search for all the pairs of specified quantities whose total cost was close to the price specified by the user.

Since, the definition of close is ambiguous, I have given an option to the user, where he can choose how much the price can vary. User can click on the images for more product details.
